Anakin! How many times have I told you stay away from power couplings! That was good. Where are you going?! He went that way.'),(5,2,3,'Master, if we keep this chase going, that creep''s gonna end up deep fried. Personally, I''d very much like to find out who he is and who he''s working for... This is a shortcut. I think.'),(5,3,2,'Well, you''ve lost him.'),(5,2,3,'I''m deeply sorry, Master.'),(5,3,2,'That was some shortcut, Anakin. He went completely the other way.

Your patience has paid off'),(5,2,1,'Your guidance more than my patience.'),(5,1,2,'You don''t need guidance, Anakin. In time, you will learn to trust your feelings. Then you will be invincible.

Anakin, help me! What''s bothering you?'),(6,2,6,'Nothing... I remember when I gave this to you.'),(6,6,2,'How long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?'),(6,2,6,'It was a dream.'),(6,6,2,'Bad?'),(6,2,6,'Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.'),(6,6,2,'And?'),(6,2,6,'And it was about you.'),(6,6,2,'Tell me.'),(6,2,6,'It was only a dream.

Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.'),(6,2,7,'What must I do, Master Yoda?'),(6,7,2,'Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.'),(6,3,2,'You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.'),(6,2,3,'I''m sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse.'),(6,3,2,'In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.'),(6,2,3,'What''s wrong then?'),(6,3,2,'The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.'),(6,2,3,'Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.'),(6,3,2,'Be careful of your friend Palpatine.'),(6,2,3,'Be careful of what?'),(6,3,2,'He has requested your presence.'),(6,2,3,'What for?'),(6,3,2,'He would not say.'),(6,2,3,'He didn''t inform the Council? That''s unusual, isn''t it?'),(6,3,2,'All of this is unusual, and it''s making me feel uneasy.'),(6,1,2,'I hope you trust me, Anakin.'),(6,2,1,'Of course.'),(6,1,2,'I need your help, son.'),(6,2,1,'What do you mean?'),(6,1,2,'I''m depending on you.'),(6,2,1,'For what? I don''t understand.'),(6,1,2,'To be the eyes, ears and voice of the Republic. Anakin... I''m appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.'),(6,2,1,'Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They''ll never accept this.'),(6,1,2,'I think they will... they need you more than you know.'),(6,7,2,'Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.'),(6,2,7,'I understand.'),(6,8,2,'You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.'),(6,2,8,'What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it''s unfair... How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?'),(6,8,2,'Take a seat, young Skywalker.'),(6,2,8,'Forgive me, Master.'),(6,3,7,'We do not have many ships to spare.'),(6,8,7,'It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!'),(6,3,7,'He''s right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose.'),(6,7,8,'Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.'),(6,8,2,'It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.'),(6,2,3,'What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That''s never been done in the history of the Jedi. It''s insulting!'),(6,3,2,'Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age... It''s never happened before. The fact of the matter is you''re too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn''t like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.'),(6,2,3,'I swear to you, I didn''t ask to be put on the Council...'),(6,3,2,'But it''s what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.'),(6,2,3,'That has nothing to do with this.'),(6,3,2,'The only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.'),(6,2,3,'And?'),(6,3,2,'Anakin, I am on your side. I didn''t want to put you in this situation.'),(6,2,3,'What situation?'),(6,3,2,'The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor''s dealings. They want to know what he''s up to.'),(6,2,3,'They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That''s treason!'),(6,3,2,'We are at war, Anakin.'),(6,2,3,'Why didn''t the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?'),(6,3,2,'This assignment is not to be on record.'),(6,2,3,'The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He''s watched out for me ever since I arrived here.'),(6,3,2,'That is why you must help us. Anakin, our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.'),(6,2,3,'The Senate demanded that he stay longer.'),(6,3,2,'Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.'),(6,2,3,'You''re asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor... and a friend. That''s what''s out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?'),(6,3,2,'The Council is asking you.'),(6,3,7,'Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.'),(6,8,3,'It''s very dangerous, putting them together. I don''t think the boy can handle it. I don''t trust him.'),(6,3,8,'With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?'),(6,8,3,'So the prophecy says.'),(6,7,3,'A prophecy... that misread could have been.'),(6,3,7,'He will not let me down. He never has.'),(6,7,3,'I hope right you are.'),(6,2,6,'Sometimes, I wonder what''s happening to the Jedi Order... I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.'),(6,6,2,'Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?'),(6,2,6,'What do you mean?'),(6,6,2,'What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we''ve been fighting to destroy?'),(6,2,6,'I don''t believe that. And you''re sounding like a Separatist!'),(6,6,2,'This war represents a failure to listen... Now, you''re closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.'),(6,2,6,'Don''t ask me to do that. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs.'),(6,6,2,'What is it?'),(6,2,6,'Nothing.'),(6,6,2,'Don''t do this... don''t shut me out. Let me help you. Hold me... like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago... when there was nothing but our love... No politics, no plotting... no war.'),(6,2,1,'You wanted to see me, Chancellor.'),(6,1,2,'Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He''s hiding in the Utapau system.'),(6,2,1,'At last, we''ll be able to capture that monster and end this war.'),(6,1,2,'I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn''t select you for this assignment. You are the best choice, by far. Sit down,'),(6,1,2,'Anakin, you know I''m not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven''t included you in their plot, they soon will.'),(6,2,1,'I''m not sure I understand.'),(6,1,2,'You must sense what I have come to suspect... the Jedi Council want control of the Republic... they''re planning to betray me.'),(6,2,1,'I don''t think...'),(6,1,2,'Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don''t you?'),(6,2,1,'I know they don''t trust you...'),(6,1,2,'Or the Senate... or the Republic... or democracy for that matter.'),(6,2,1,'I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.'),(6,1,2,'Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn''t they? They asked you to spy on me, didn''t they?'),(6,2,1,'I don''t uh... I don''t know what to say.'),(6,1,2,'Remember back to your early teachings. "All who gain power are afraid to lose it." Even the Jedi.'),(6,2,1,'The Jedi use their power for good.'),(6,1,2,'Good is a point of view, Anakin. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power.'),(6,2,1,'The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inwards, only about themselves.'),(6,1,2,'And the Jedi don''t?'),(6,2,1,'The Jedi are selfless... they only care about others.'),(6,1,2,'Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise?'),(6,2,1,'No.'),(6,1,2,'I thought not. It''s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It''s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.'),(6,2,1,'He could actually save people from death?'),(6,1,2,'The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.'),(6,2,1,'What happened to him?'),(6,1,2,'He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It''s ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.'),(6,2,1,'Is it possible to learn this power?'),(6,1,2,'Not from a Jedi.'),(6,2,3,'A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.'),(6,7,2,'Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.'),(6,2,3,'The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.'),(6,8,2,'The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.'),(6,7,2,'A Master is needed, with more experience.'),(6,7,2,'I agree.'),(6,8,2,'Aye Very well. Council is adjourned.'),(6,2,3,'You''re going to need me on this one, Master.'),(6,3,2,'Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.'),(6,2,3,'Master! I''ve disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training... I have been arrogant and I apologize... I''ve just been so frustrated with the Council.'),(6,3,2,'You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be. But be patient, Anakin. It won''t be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master.'),(6,2,3,'Obi-Wan. May the Force be with you.'),(6,3,2,'Good-bye, old friend.

What do you mean?'),(6,2,6,'Obi-Wan and the Council don''t trust me.'),(6,6,2,'They trust you with their lives.'),(6,2,6,'Something''s happening... I''m not the Jedi I should be. I want more, and I know I shouldn''t.'),(6,6,2,'You expect too much of yourself.'),(6,2,6,'I have found a way to save you.'),(6,6,2,'Save me?'),(6,2,6,'From my nightmares.'),(6,6,2,'Is that what''s bothering you?'),(6,2,6,'I won''t lose you, Padme.'),(6,6,2,'I''m not going to die in childbirth, Annie.

I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.'),(6,1,2,'They don''t trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control.

If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.'),(6,2,1,'What did you say?'),(6,1,2,'Use my knowledge, I beg you...'),(6,2,1,'You''re the Sith Lord!'),(6,1,2,'I know what has been troubling you...
